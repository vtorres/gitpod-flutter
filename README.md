[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dario61081/proyecto-gss)


## Setup

### Web

```
  flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8080 --web-hostname=0.0.0.0
```

### Mobile with remote adb

###### Check your mobile lan ip and feel free to use your own port configuration

```
  SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP = 192.168.0.10 (LAN IP)
  INTERNAL_PORT = 5555
```

###### [Localhost command] Run the following command to switch adb on your device to work over the network using the internal port

```
  adb tcpip INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Localhost command] Check adb connection from localhost

```
  adb connect SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP:INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Localhost command] Starts ngrok tcp forwarding to your mobile or if you prefer you can forward a chosen port on your router to the mobile

- Ngrok describes itself as “expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet.”, making our lives easier.

```
  ngrok tcp SMARTPHONE_LOCAL_IP:INTERNAL_PORT
```

###### [Gitpod command] Connect from your Gitpod to your localhost for debugging

```
  adb connect NGROK_ADDRESS:NGROK_PORT
  flutter run -d NGROK_ADDRESS:NGROK_PORT
```
